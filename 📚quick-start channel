***Welcome to the ZIPP community !***

**__Who are we ?__**
We are home to a wide variety of creators, such as developers, artists, writers, and more, and we are all sharing the same goal of slowly freeing the world of copyrights, patents & co, as well as all of the issues associated with them.

**__What are copyrights, etc. ?__**
If you've ever heard one of your favorite YouTuber or streamer complain about __copyright strikes__, or couldn't access some content on a website because of something called __DMCA__ then you're in the right place. We're here to fix that.

If you aren't yet familiar with the issue though, I'd highly recommend checking these two videos by the person who inspired this server, *Uniquenameosaurus*.

In no time you'll understand all the ins and outs on the matter.

**__What's a better alternative then ?__**
Two better alternatives stand out : __open-source__ and __public domain__.

Public domain (or CC0) means that whatever you created is available to anyone, for free, and that they can do whatever they want with it.

Open-source means that anyone can see *how* you made something. They can learn from it, or even remix your creation if it's also public domain.

If you're interested by the technical details, here are a few links to get you started.
• https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain
• https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/
• https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/open-source/what-is-open-source

**__What is our plan of action ?__**
Taking notes from __Uniquenameosaurus__, we're gonna create our own companies and projects to accompany him in his journey.

Ideally, at one point there would be enough of us creating inspiring content, and enough people would start noticing us, that companies would understand it's ok to follow in our footsteps and be more open about intellectual property.

**__How can you support us ?__**
If we could dedicate ourselves fully to the creation of public domain and open-source works, we could accomplish our goals much faster.

If you want to support us monetarily, please consider donating to our Patreon.

**__How can WE support YOU ?__**
We are always looking for more talented creators to join our cause. If you have a project in the works, and are interested but unsure whether you should make it public domain or open-source, or how to even do it, we're here to guide you.

However, if you are 100% sure that you want your project to be public domain, we'd be more than happy to make a home for it in this server, advertise it online, and eventually support you monetarily as you complete important milestones.

We'll make updates about the various projects within our community, or big events and milestones within the world of intellectual property.
